# MyRecipePal
Software Engineering Group Project


### About the project

MyRecipePal is a social media platform designed for food enthusiasts to share and discover recipes.
It allows users to post recipes with instructions along with photos, receive comments such as feedback and likes from the community. 
It will also have a search function that allows users to find recipes based on ingredients, cuisine types and dietary types. 
Users can also create and customise their profiles, posting recipes and also show off their culinary achievements. Users that reach a certain number of likes and comments will earn a badge which will show off on their profile. 
This application is targeted at individuals who are looking for new recipes or want to share their family recipes, for example home cooks or food enthusiasts.
